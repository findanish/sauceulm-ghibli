# Screenshot Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder files for screenshots that should be replaced with actual screenshots of your SauceULM_ Admin Dashboard.

To add screenshots:

2. Save them with the following names:
   - dashboard-preview.png (main dashboard overview)
   - okta-view.png (Okta management interface)
   - slack-view.png (Slack management interface)
   - google-view.png (Google Workspace management interface)
   - audit-logs.png (Audit logs interface)

These screenshots will be displayed in the README.md file to showcase your dashboard's features and design.
